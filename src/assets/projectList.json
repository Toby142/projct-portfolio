Initially, this was supposed to be done through Upwork, a platform for hiring freelancers, specifically a Shopify developer, as I had no prior experience with Shopify. KCPerformance already had an existing webshop, but it faced multiple issues, which led to the decision to create a new one. Since I was unfamiliar with the webshop and its problems, I decided to conduct a thorough analysis. I researched and documented the webshop’s structure and its pain points [1], allowing me to gain a clear understanding of the existing situation.",

While this approach was valuable, I realize that a more in-depth logical analysis would have been beneficial for future projects. The design process itself was less structured than I would have liked. Although I am satisfied with the final result—a wireframe [2] and a completed design [3]—I wish I had spent more time researching how successful webshops function and perform well on Google before starting the design process. After completing my designs, I received feedback, which I documented and carefully considered for possible improvements [4].",
